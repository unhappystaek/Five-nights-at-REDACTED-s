# Five_nights_at_[REDACTED]'s
## Game
Game mechanics are based on Scott Cawthon's "Five nights at Freddy's".
My idea was to make "crappy off brand" of this game, with me and my friends as animatronics. 
Oh and also game contains IP grabber but it is an easter egg.

## Retards:
Freddy - Lee Hoota
Foxy - Vier
Bonny - Fuzow
Chica - Terpil

## Used assets
Most textures use CC0 license or are made by me/my friends
